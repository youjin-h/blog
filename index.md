## About

Hi✋🏻 I am Youjin Hwang Ph.D candidate at hci+d lab., <a href = "https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" target="_blank">Seoul National University</a>. My current research interest includes designing conversational AI for healthcare and well-being. Particularly, I aim to strengthen emotional support from the loved ones  (e.g.family) of the user via conversational AI. Also, I am working on designing conversational AI mimicking the person in the real world. As a HCI researcher, I also deliver lectures and workshops for the public with the themes of HCI, human-AI interaction, and design thinking.
